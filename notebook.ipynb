      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for at least 1 hour.\n",
      "2. Drain the rice and steam it until it is fully cooked.\n",
      "3. Let the rice cool down to room temperature.\n",
      "4. In a large bowl, mix the nuruk and sugar with the cooked rice.\n",
      "5. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it ferment in a warm place for 3-4 days.\n",
      "6. After the fermentation process is complete, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth to remove any solids.\n",
      "7. Transfer the liquid to a clean container and let it sit for another 1-2 days to allow the flavors to develop.\n",
      "8. Your homemade soju is now ready to be enjoyed! Serve chilled and enjoy responsibly. Ingredients:\n",
      "- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 packet active dry yeast\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups warm water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon sugar\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\n",
      "3. Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.\n",
      "5. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place the loaf in a greased loaf pan, cover, and let it rise for another 30 minutes.\n",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for about 30-35 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "7. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool before slicing and serving. Enjoy your freshly baked bread! \n",
